[NUSRoutes](https://nusroutes.vercel.app/) is a web app with an intuitively clear and concise UI for NUS Shuttle Bus Services, including a route recommendation feature.

## Features
 - Route recommendation of shortest bus route from one place to another within NUS.

## How are we different from NUSNextBUS?

  * Let NUSRoutes do it for you!
