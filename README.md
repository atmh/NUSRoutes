## How are we different from NUSNextBUS?
* Route recommendation
  * Manual route planning with NUSNextBUS is a thing of the past.
  * Let NUSRoutes do it for you!

* Proximity Alarm
  * Tired and want to take a quick nap?
  * NUSRoutes got you covered and notifies when your destination is nearing.

* Web app
  * No download required!
  * Runs on the browser and is cross-platform.

* Elegant and intuitive user interface
  * A few clicks is all it takes.
  * We put in our best effort to make NUSRoutes modern yet super intuitive.
