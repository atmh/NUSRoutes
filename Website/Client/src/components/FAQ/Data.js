    question: "How do I use NUSRoutes?",
    answer: `If you are using our service through our website, 
      simply navigate to the main page and select your current location and destination from the dropdown menu and press get route.`,
  },
  {
    question: "What devices is NUSRoutes supported on?",
    answer: `Mobile users are free to use the web-version of NUSRoutes or our telegram bot. 
            As for laptop/desktop users, you can access our route recommendation service through our website.`,
  },
  {
    question: "How is NUSRoutes better than the NUS NextBus App?",
    answer: `Our main feature includes a route recommendation service that tells you what NUS shuttle bus service you would need to take 
    in order for you to reach your destination.`,
  },
  {
    question: "If I have encountered issues, who do I contact?",
    answer: `We have a contact us section where you are able to feedback the bugs/issues you have encountered. You can navigate to the section via the navigation bar from the 
    main page of our website.`,
  },
  {
    question: "Why does it take quite awhile for the webpage to load?",
    answer: `This is because our website is hosted on heroku and if the application is left unused for awhile, it gets unloaded from heroku's server memory. Hence, it would take some time for
    heroku to boot up our application for the first load. Subsequent loads thereafter should be faster as the application has already been booted up.`
  },
  {
    question:
      "Would it be possible to view the bus arrival timings without having to prompt the app for a route recommendation?",
    answer: "This feature is currently only available on our telegram bot.",
  }
